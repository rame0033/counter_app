#Passenger Counter Application

Project courtesy of [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v) - this is the first project I made for practicing JavaScript.

- Started off with the script tag to link the JavaScript file to HTML file.
- Writing variables to hold certain values
- Do increment numbers
- Add string to build the save feature (Numbers log)
- Create and invoke a function
- Using the DOM to interact with the website. (E.g. using the .getElementById())
- Using `textContent` to render proper spacing between the logged numbers and '-'
